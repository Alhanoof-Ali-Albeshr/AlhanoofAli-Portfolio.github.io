What's Inside My Tote Bag In 2025?
======

I tried to order the items from most important to least important (the left side is more important, and the right side is not            important). However, I soon realized that almost more than a half of the things in my bag are there "just in case" - thus they are rarely put into use.

Here is what is inside my bag: 

*(Items I use/need): 
- Phone & Phone case
- My car keys
- My phone c-cable
- My computer (I wish someone could invent something smaller, lighter in weight and with the same functionalities).
  
*(Just in case items):
- Laptop charger
- Small notebook
- Sanitizer
- Lipstick
- Panadol cold&flu
- Vitamin D pills
- Bottle of water (probably has been there since the J-term ðŸ˜­)
- Perfume
- Pencil case (containing pens, pencils, sharpies, highlighters, pencil sharpener, and a stapler)
- Folder with a small stack of white paper
- Cardholder (containing driving license, NYUAD ID, NYUAD FAB card, travel credit card, and main credit card).

                                                                                                     Posted on 29/01/2025
