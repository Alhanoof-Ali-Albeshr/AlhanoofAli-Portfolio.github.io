What's Inside My Tote Bag In 2025?
======
Posted on 29/01/2025

I tried to order the items from most important to least important (the left side is more important, and the right side is not            important). However, I soon realized that almost more than a half of the things in my bag are there "just in case" - thus they are rarely put into use.

Here is what is inside my bag: 

*(Items I use/need): 
- Phone & Phone case
- My car keys
- My phone c-cable
- My computer (I wish someone could invent something smaller, lighter in weight and with the same functionalities).
  
*(Just in case items):
- Laptop charger
- Small notebook
- Sanitizer
- Lipstick
- Panadol cold&flu
- Vitamin D pills
- Bottle of water (probably has been there since the J-term ðŸ˜­)
- Perfume
- Pencil case (containing pens, pencils, sharpies, highlighters, pencil sharpener, and a stapler)
- Folder with a small stack of white paper
- Cardholder (containing driving license, NYUAD ID, NYUAD FAB card, travel credit card, and main credit card).

Summary on Pessimist Archive's Podcat on Masks

Breif summary and commentary on the podcast: 

Rather than discussing the history of masks, the Podcast delved into human psychology, more specifically into when and why people are more likely to comply in one instance rather than another. The Podcast begins by discussing the mandate of masks during 1918 and discusses the reason people from Sanfrinsico complied (which was to stay safe from the Spanish flu and because it was seen as a patriotic duty). This mirrors recent events such as COVID-19 and how many complied out of fear of the virus and out of compliance with government regulations. However, the Podcast mentioned that towards the end of 1918, San Fran Sisco lifted the mandate, so people thought the Spanish flu was over. But, to their surprise, another wave hit, and the government re-mandated the mask. Interestingly, many people did not comply with the mandate this time, and the "Anti-Mask League" was created. People were meeting and protesting because they did not want to wear masks because they felt they were ineffective and unsafe (e.g., many wore them to cover their faces and commit crimes) or did not want to wear them. 

But why? Why were masks accepted the first time but not the second time? 

The Podcast actually attempts to tackle this question and mentions "Reactance" (when people think their autonomy is taken away, as an attempt to take it back, they refuse to comply). was why. The Podcast mentioned two ways to solve this issue: to give people a choice or highlight social norms. To give an example of choice-giving, COVID-19 vaccines were not mandated in the UAE. As in, the government did not force anyone to get vaccinated. They gave people a choice: either to get vaccinated or not be able to access malls, shops, or any closed public area. This way, although it might not seem like it, people still had the choice to get vaccinated, which made them more likely to comply. Moreover, to give an example about social norms, one can do this by stating that everyone around them is doing something. For example, if you tell a household that the whole neighborhood is wearing masks, they will be likelier to wear them because they would want to fit in and not be criticized or seen as different from the people in their neighborhood. So, the key point that the Podcast is making is that if you want people to do something, you need to explore human psychology to do it - rather than merely mandating or forcing them to do it because forcing them will only work for so long.

My Concept Project: Connection 
======
What my I hoped my project would surround is this idea of connections between innovations in the past and innovations now, and how one thing led to another. These connections not always are clear or make sense, yet they happened. What inspired me was the tv BBC tv show Connections. And so, my proejcts aimed to depict the uncertainty and chaotic process of inventions and how they led and connect to one another.

Before showing my projects here is a breif run down of my process: 

- Started exploring playing cards their history.
- Then I landed on lenticular playing cards. At this point, I wanted to do something in relation to connections but didn't really know what to do.   
- I then moved on from lenticulars and began thinking of creating cards of survivability highlighting the connections in the past and how we adapted technology across time. This is sort of like a card deck that would save history in case it got erased in the future.  
- Then I moved back to cards and thinking of ways to fold them to depict the different concetions via folding them sort of like oragami.
- Then I circled back to lenticular cards and landed on my last idea which is to create a mini puzzle out of them. Essentially, there would be 12 squares in the cards, each square representing an innovation and its consequence. You would have to cut these squares and rearrange them finding the connection between the innovations. I was also inspired by the zootrope and wated to mount these squares to make them sort of like a moving movie and so I created a card where the users could attach the tiny squares. After mounting htem on it, they would have to move the circular card as if it was a CD, and then they could see the images move.

Here are the images (before prinitng) of my project:
