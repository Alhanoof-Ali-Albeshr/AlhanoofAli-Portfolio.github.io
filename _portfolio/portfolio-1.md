title: "What's Inside My Tote Bag In 2025?"
excerpt: "I tried to order the items from most important to least important (the left side is more important, and the right side is not            important). However, I soon realized that almost more than a half of the things in my bag are there "just in case" - thus they are rarely put into use. 
*(Items I use/need): Phone & Phone case, my car keys, my phone c-cable, and my computer (I wish someone could invent something smaller, lighter in weight and with the same functionalities).
*(Just in case items): Laptop charger, small notebook, sanitizer, Lipstick, Panadol cold&flu, vitamin D pills, bottle of water, perfume, pencil case (containing pens, pencils, sharpies, highlighters, pencil sharpener, and a stapler), folder with a small stack of white paper, cardholder (containing driving license, NYUAD ID, NYUAD FAB card, travel credit card, and main credit card).
